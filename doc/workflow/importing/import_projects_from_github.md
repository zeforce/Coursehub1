# Import your project from GitHub to GitLab

>**Note:**
In order to enable the GitHub import setting, you should first
enable the [GitHub integration][gh-import] in your GitLab instance.

At its current state, GitHub importer can import:

- the repository description (introduced in GitLab 7.7)
- the git repository data (introduced in GitLab 7.7)
- the issues (introduced in GitLab 7.7)
- the pull requests (introduced in GitLab 8.4)
- the wiki pages (introduced in GitLab 8.4)
- the milestones (introduced in GitLab 8.7)
- the labels (introduced in GitLab 8.7)

With GitLab 8.7+, references to pull requests and issues are preserved.

It is not yet possible to import your cross-repository pull requests (those from
forks). We are working on improving this in the near future.

The importer page is visible when you [create a new project][new-project].
Click on the **GitHub** link and you will be redirected to GitHub for
permission to access your projects. After accepting, you'll be automatically
redirected to the importer.

While at the GitHub importer page, you can see the import statuses of your
GitHub projects. Those that are being imported will show a _started_ status,
those already imported will be green, whereas those that are not yet imported
have an **Import** button on the right side of the table. If you want, you can
import all your GitHub projects in one go by hitting **Import all projects**
in the upper left corner.

The importer will create any new namespaces if they don't exist or in the
case the namespace is taken, the project will be imported on the user's
namespace.
